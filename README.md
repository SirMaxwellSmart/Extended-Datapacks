# **The "Extended" Datapacks**

The "Extended" Datapacks were created to extend the default minecraft crafting experiences.
Inspiration began with wish to be able to go "backwards" with the stonecutter, and other tweaks were added as I went.

## **Datapacks**

**1. Stonecutting Extended**
- Adds stonecutting 'groups' that allow seamless change between all blocks within that group. (Unless the default output is more than one.)
- E.g. Sandstone -> Chiseled Sandstone -> Sandstone Stairs -> Sandstone etc.

---

**2. Woodcutting Extended**
- Adds standard stonecutter recipes for all wood variants along with the stonecutter additions listed above.

---

**3. Stairs Extended**
- Updates the default minecraft stair crafting recipes to give you 6 instead of 4 to match the efficiency of the stonecutter.
